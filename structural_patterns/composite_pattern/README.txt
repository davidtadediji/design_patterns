Composite Pattern
What it is: The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

How it works: The pattern involves defining a component interface that both individual objects (leaf nodes) and composite objects (parent nodes containing child components) implement. The composite object can hold other components (either leaves or other composites), while the leaf nodes are the end objects in the tree structure.

Why it works: It works by allowing clients to treat individual objects and composite objects in the same way. This simplifies the client code as it doesnâ€™t need to differentiate between individual and composite objects.

Where it is used:

File systems (where files and directories are treated uniformly).
GUI components (where buttons, text fields, and other widgets can be treated as individual or composite components).
Organizational structures (e.g., companies, where both employees and managers can be treated as components of the hierarchy).
Advantages:

Makes the structure easier to manage by treating both individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.
Simplifies client code by allowing operations on both leaf and composite objects without special case handling.
Promotes flexible tree structures that can grow dynamically.


The Composite pattern is inherently suited for problems that involve recursion, and this is one of its core strengths.

Why the Composite Pattern Works Well with Recursion:
Hierarchical Structure:

The Composite pattern represents a tree-like structure, where each "composite" can contain other components (leaves or composites). This structure naturally aligns with recursive algorithms, as tree traversal (preorder, postorder, etc.) inherently uses recursion.
Uniformity in Operations:

The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites) uniformly because they implement the same interface. This simplifies recursive logic, as you don't need to special-case leaf nodes or composites.
For example, you can call showDetails() or getSize() on any FileSystemComponent, whether it's a Directory (composite) or a File (leaf).
Breaking Down Problems:

Recursive algorithms work by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems. The Composite pattern models this naturally: a composite delegates operations to its children, which may themselves be composites or leaves.
